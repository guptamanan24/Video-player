npm start
Starts the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it. The app will reload with any changes you make, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, check out the test documentation.

npm run build
Builds the app for production in the build folder. It optimizes the app for the best performance with minified code and hashed filenames. Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run eject
Warning: This is a one-way operation. If you choose to eject, you'll get full control over the build configuration, but you won't be able to go back. Use this if you need to customize the build tools and configurations beyond what is provided by Create React App.
